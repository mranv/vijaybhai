<p class=MsoNormal>Mobile Phone Cloning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every phone has a 128 bit number stored on the sim card
called the Ki. This number is given to us by the telephone operator that gives
us our mobile phone service. This number Ki or secret key is also stored on the
computers of our network provider. When we switch our phone on, the tower needs
to identify us as a valid subscriber. Obviously the tower has to be owned by
our network operator. The tower needs to authenticate us, the phone never
authenticates the tower. The tower sends us a random number that is 128 bits
also. The Ki is used to generate a 32 bit number called SRES using a algorithm
called A3. Thus Ki is also called a password or secret key. A3 is a one way
algorithm like MD5, it takes two inputs and gives us a 32 bit output. The
computers controlling the tower send the tower the random number RAND and the
answer SRES. The tower checks the value of SRES returned by the phone and if it
is the same as the one it has received from its computers, it knows that the
phone has the same value of Ki as it has. This is how the phone gets
authenticated by the tower. Thus if we can figure out the value of Ki, we can
get authenticated by the system. The ki stored on the sim card cannot be read
by anyone outside of the sim card. It is stored on the sim card in such a way
that the microprocessor will not allow us to access it. This security so far
has not been broken. The mobile phone also needs to encrypt the data or our
voice that is send across. To do this it needs a session key or Kc which it
will use to encrypt data. Kc should be a 64 bit key that uses a symmetrical
algorithm called A5 to encrypt our voice. Both sides need the same value of the
session key. Thus the network computer sends the tower three values, RAND, SRES
and Kc. The tower uses Kc to encrypt and decrypt the voice data to and from the
mobile phone. To generate Kc we use an algorithm A8.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>A3 and A8 are placed in one program called COMP128 or A38. The
program A5 is burned in hardware and set as transistors as we need real time
encryption. The mobile phone number is not stored on the phone at all. A5 is on
the phone itself as everyone uses the same. Every operator can choose the A3
and A8 algorithims and they are placed in the SIM card. When roaming we only
send the SRAND, SRES and KC over, never the Ki. If the Ki is compromised then
we have a problem as all gsm security depends on it.</p>
