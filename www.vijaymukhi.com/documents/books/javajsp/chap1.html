      <p>Things that you are aware of today haven't always existed nor have they 
        suddenly emerged. They have evolved over a period of time to fulfill our 
        ever-growing needs. Similarly, Java has evolved as the savior to meet 
        the growing needs of the world. It incorporates useful elements from languages 
        like C and C++. </p>
      <p>When you surf the Internet, you use a browser, which is also called a 
        user agent, that enables you to view web pages and transfer data over 
        the Internet. The most familiar among the browsers are Netscape Navigator 
        and Internet Explorer. So what happens when you view a web page? Technically 
        speaking, you connect to a web server and download an html file. In other 
        words, this html file comes over onto your computer. Before Java, the 
        downloaded file contained no intelligence. In that sense, the web page 
        was static. Sun Microsystems answered our need for dynamism by developing 
        Java. Java brought with it the ability to download an actual program and 
        at the same time execute it in our browser.</p>
      <p>'Will Java save the world or not?' Inquisitive as you may be, wait a 
        while and you will enjoy the fruits of patience. The philosophy of Java 
        and its history can be understood only gradually, in light of the knowledge 
        you will soon gain. </p>
      <p>Having looked into the brief origin of Java let us start on our journey.</p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">JAVA, The Programming Language </font></b></p>
      <p>Let us begin with the basics. Every programming language has certain 
        rules and programs written in that language have to follow these rules. 
        A similarity can be drawn to spoken languages like English, French, etc. 
        each of which has its own rules. </p>
      <p>Given below is the smallest program written in the Java Programming language. 
        To begin writing your first program, you must click on the Start button, 
        go to the dos prompt and type edit z.java. But before typing in edit, 
        create a sub directory called javaprg where you will save all your files. 
        We have called the sub directory javaprg but you can call it by any name 
        you like.<br>
        c:\javaprg&gt;edit z.java </p>
      <p>z.java<br>
        class zzz<br>
        {<br>
        }</p>
      <p>Now, type the code given above. Once you have written the code, you must 
        save the file. In order to do so, activate the menu option File by pressing 
        the keys Alt-F and then the menu option Exit. Press Y at the MessageBox 
        which asks you whether you want to save the file or not. </p>
      <p>We have done our coding under Windows but you can do the same under Linux 
        or any other Operating System, the results will be the same.</p>
      <p>Let's understand the code.</p>
      <p>This program begins with the word class. A class is a collection. Every 
        class is identified by its name. In this program, we have named the class 
        zzz. In case you are sleepy, you might think of it as a snore, in that 
        case, change the name to awake. In other words, a class can be given any 
        name you like. But if you'd rather followed our naming conventions, then 
        name it zzz. </p>
      <p>A class being a collection obviously means you have to put something 
        in it. In order to contain something in a class use curly braces,'{' to 
        indicate the start and '}' to indicate the end of a collection. <br>
        The program must begin with the word class followed by '{' and '}'. This 
        is what we mean by programming language rules. Each programming language 
        has its own grammar, its own syntax for writing code. </p>
      <p>Every Java program has to have at least one class and anything to do 
        with Java has to be placed in a class. </p>
      <p>Now, something has to understand the code that you have just typed and 
        that something is the compiler. So you now need to run this, the smallest 
        Java program, through a Java compiler and execute it. The compiler in 
        the Java programming language is called javac. Javac is part of what is 
        called the Java Development Kit or JDK in short. The JDK can be freely 
        downloaded from the Sun Microsystems site. In order to execute your program, 
        give the command javac z.java at the dos prompt. </p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac z.java</p>
      <p>No errors, Great!! Now execute the dir command. </p>
      <p>( If you see any errors on your screen, set the path variable as c:\javaprg&gt;set 
        PATH=c:\jdk1.2.2\bin;%PATH% )</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;dir</p>
      <p>Volume in drive C is SONAL <br>
        Volume Serial Number is 0661-13EE<br>
        Directory of C:\javaprg</p>
      <p>. &lt;DIR&gt; 04-26-00 4:11p .<br>
        .. &lt;DIR&gt; 04-26-00 4:11p ..<br>
        ZZZ~1 CLA 178 04-26-00 4:15p zzz.class<br>
        Z~1 JAV 17 04-26-00 4:12p z.java<br>
        2 file(s) 195 bytes<br>
        2 dir(s) 5,214.56 MB free</p>
      <p><br>
        You will see two files listed. One is the .java file that you created 
        and the other is a file with the .class extension. Javac - the java compiler 
        expects the java program to have a .java file extension. </p>
      <p>On closer observation, you will notice that the .class file is displayed 
        as zzz.class. The name of the .java file i.e. z.java is of little importance 
        to the java compiler. The compiler gives weight to the class name, which 
        in our case is zzz. Thus, the file named zzz.class gets created. Had we 
        named the class xxx, the resultant file would have been xxx.class. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Applets</font></b></p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, one of the advantages of Java is that it enables 
        you to create programs that execute within a browser. Henceforth, we will 
        call a java program an applet. Thus, an applet is a java program which 
        can be executed within a browser. It helps transform the static HTML pages 
        into documents full of life, interaction and vitality.</p>
      <p>How can we execute an applet in a browser?</p>
      <p>Browsers only understand html or html tags. Amongst these tags there 
        is one by the name of applet. You embed an applet in an HTML page using 
        the applet tag. To understand this better, create a file called a.html. 
        This can be done using any word processor. Type the following code:</p>
      <p>a.html<br>
        &lt;applet code=zzz.class&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;</p>
      <p>What does this mean? &lt;applet&gt; is a tag and &lt;/applet&gt; indicates 
        the end of the tag. The code attribute is used to provide the name of 
        the class file, which in our case is zzz.class. Alternatively, you can 
        simply write zzz. Our code resides in the class file. Now that you have 
        embedded the applet in an HTML file by the name of a.html, you will need 
        to open a.html in a browser. </p>
      <p>You can use Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator to open this file. 
        However, there is a possibility that you may have neither IE nor Netscape. 
        Not only did Sun consider this possibility but also when they first released 
        java there were no browsers that supported it. Hence they gave us a browser 
        that understands only the applet tag, one that can run only java applets. 
        They called this browser the appletviewer.</p>
      <p>We will use the appletviewer. At the command prompt type appletviewer 
        a.html</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>Warning: &lt;applet&gt; tag requires width attribute.<br>
        Warning: No Applets were started. Make sure the input contains an &lt;applet&gt; 
        tag.<br>
        usage: appletviewer [-debug] [-J&lt;javaflag&gt;] [-encoding &lt;character 
        encoding type&gt; ] url|file ...</p>
      <p>What do these warnings mean? The appletviewer has come back with warnings 
        saying that it needs an attribute called width. </p>
      <p>Since the applet will be shown in the browser window, it needs the width 
        to ascertain how large width-wise, the window should be. Add the width 
        attribute in the html file as follows: <br>
        a.html<br>
        &lt;applet code=zzz.class width=200&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;</p>
      <p>Now run the applet viewer by typing the following:<br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>Output<br>
        Warning: &lt;applet&gt; tag requires height attribute.Warning: No Applets 
        were started. Make sure the input contains an &lt;applet&gt; tag.usage: 
        appletviewer [-debug] [-J&lt;javaflag&gt;] [-encoding &lt;character encoding 
        type&gt; ] url|file ...</p>
      <p>The appletviewer comes back asking for another attribute called height. 
        Java doesn't seem to believe in the 'reveal all' concept, it divulges 
        slowly. You have no choice but to add the height attribute in a.html. 
        The order here is not important, the attributes can be interchanged. A 
        browser would display the applet in its window. Thus, it wants to know 
        the width and height of the window it should give the applet. </p>
      <p>Your code should resemble the following:</p>
      <p>a.html<br>
        &lt;applet code=zzz.class width=200 height=300&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;</p>
      <p>Run the appletviewer. It should run this time.</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>Finally, the appletviewer seems to give no problems. You see a small 
        window, at the bottom of which, are displayed some messages and finally 
        it says, Start: applet not initialized. </p>
      <p>The above indicates that the applet didn't work. We have an error. Close 
        the window and return to dos. Here you will see the following error message 
        or messages.</p>
      <p>load: zzz.class is not public or has no public constructor.<br>
        java.lang.IllegalAccessException: zzz<br>
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Native Method)<br>
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:241)<br>
        at sun.applet.AppletPanel.createApplet(AppletPanel.java:508)<br>
        at sun.applet.AppletPanel.runLoader(AppletPanel.java:444)<br>
        at sun.applet.AppletPanel.run(AppletPanel.java:282)<br>
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:479)</p>
      <p>The message says that zzz.class is not public. What does this message 
        mean? Error messages are rarely meant to be user friendly and can sometimes 
        be difficult to decipher.<br>
        A Java program is executable code that comes across the net on to your 
        computer. It could be programmed to delete your entire hard disk. In that 
        case, you would refrain from visiting sites on the Internet due to lack 
        of security. To prevent such hazards Java has a lot of inbuilt security 
        features.<br>
        The first form of security is that if you have a class and you don't put 
        the word public in front of it Java will make it private. Since it is 
        private nobody cannot access it. Thus, by default, every class is private. 
        This is like security in many modern operating systems. You are not allowed 
        to access anything unless you are given explicit permissions to do so. 
      </p>
      <p>Having understood this, we can rectify the error by adding the word public 
        in front of the class. </p>
      <p>z.java<br>
        public class zzz<br>
        {<br>
        }</p>
      <p>Now say: </p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac z.java</p>
      <p>z.java:1: Public class zzz must be defined in a file called &quot;zzz.java&quot;.<br>
        public class zzz<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>We still have an error. The program now wants the name of the Java file 
        and the name of the class file to be the same. Sounds stupid doesn't it! 
        Once you create the .class file you don't need the .java file. Don't abandon 
        Java yet! We have an error only because we have not followed the conventions, 
        the rules of the language. After all, Rules are Rules! As preposterous 
        as they may be, they are not to be questioned. </p>
      <p>Abiding by the rules, we rename this file to zzz.java. </p>
      <p>c:\javaprg&gt;ren z.java zzz.java </p>
      <p>Now say:<br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>Voila! No errors. Run appletviewer with a.html. Cross your fingers and 
        hope that all works well. </p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>As usual another error!!! The same window that we saw earlier ...Start:applet 
        not initialized.</p>
      <p>Close the window and get back to dos. You will see the following:</p>
      <p>java.lang.ClassCastException: zzz<br>
        at sun.applet.AppletPanel.createApplet(AppletPanel.java:508)<br>
        at sun.applet.AppletPanel.runLoader(AppletPanel.java:444)<br>
        at sun.applet.AppletPanel.run(AppletPanel.java:282)<br>
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:479)</p>
      <p>Here it shows you a different error, ClassCastException : zzz</p>
      <p>Now you know why you bought this book.....these lines just don't make 
        sense! You may read from up or from bottom, it still looks like greek. 
        We have learnt with experience that error messages are not meant to be 
        readable. If we knew what they meant, we wouldn't make any mistakes. </p>
      <p>Let's get back to some serious work. A class consists of functions. But 
        what are functions? A function is just program code. More on this just 
        two programs later. </p>
      <p>A class consists of functions. The appletviewer has been told to call 
        certain functions in your .class file. Appletviewer expects your applet 
        to have some code or functions in it. Unfortunately, these functions are 
        not available in your file. Currently, the class in your program is empty. 
        To avoid adding all that code required by the appletviewer, we will use 
        an existing class supplied by Sun comprising of these functions. This 
        existing class is called Applet. </p>
      <p>Sun documented the use of the word extends to inform the Java compiler 
        to merge all the functions or code from the Applet class to our class 
        zzz. Have your code match the following:</p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        }</p>
      <p>Extends simply means that if the class Applet contains 20 functions, 
        then those functions get added to zzz. It is like physically keying them 
        in yourself. Now let's run javac once again. </p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java<br>
        zzz.java:1: Superclass Applet of class zzz not found.<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>This time the error reads: 'Superclass Applet of class zzz is not found'. 
        When you borrow money from someone, he becomes the lender and you the 
        borrower. In the same way, whenever you take code from another class, 
        in this case Applet, it becomes a super class or if you like using new 
        words Applet is the baseclass and zzz the derived class. We must incorporate 
        these words in our vocabulary to learn Java. The name of the super class 
        is not Applet; it is java.applet.Applet. In case you are wondering about 
        the long names, let us remind you that you can't argue with rules. Rewrite 
        your code as given below and then run javac. <br>
        zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        }<br>
        Run javac and you won't get any errors. Running appletviewer won't give 
        errors either. But you won't see anything other than <i>'Applet Started'.</i> 
        Finally,<b> Mission Accomplished!!!</b></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Some more java conventions</b></font></p>
      <p>Let's be adventurous, put all the code on the same line. Remove the line-breaks 
        and put no spaces other than those between the words. You will find that 
        everything works fine.</p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet{}</p>
      <p>Thus, all that extra 'white space' doesn't bother the Java complier. 
        You can use these to make your program neater and thus more readable. 
      </p>
      <p>Java as a language is case-sensitive. If you replace the 'c' of class 
        with a capital 'C', it will give you errors. It will assume it to be something 
        other than class. So, remember everything is case sensitive except the 
        {} ( ;-)) . Go ahead, make the change and see for yourself! </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public Class zzz extends java.applet.Applet{}</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>zzz.java:1: 'class' or 'interface' keyword expected.<br>
        public Class zzz extends java.applet.Applet{}<br>
        ^<br>
        zzz.java:1: '{' expected.<br>
        public Class zzz extends java.applet.Applet{}<br>
        ^<br>
        zzz.java:1: Public class Class must be defined in a file called &quot;Class.java&quot;.<br>
        public Class zzz extends java.applet.Applet{}<br>
        ^<br>
        3 errors<br>
        You make one error and you get three errors instead! isn't that dumb!<br>
        So, be on your guard and don't say we didn't warn you. </p>
      <p>Let's finally understand functions with the help of this program.<br>
        zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init()<br>
        {<br>
        resize(300,40)<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>What you are writing right now, these lines of code, is what is called 
        a program. And a function is nothing but program code. We know that there 
        is a function called resize in the class called Applet. In order to call 
        a function, you need the function name. In this case, it is resize. The 
        resize function requires two values, the width and the height. This is 
        because resize changes the width and the height of the applet window. 
      </p>
      <p>Since we are learning to speak Java, let's call these 'values', 'parameters'. 
        The first parameter is the width and the second is the height. These values 
        are passed to the function within the '(' and ')' brackets. Like Java, 
        there are other programming languages like C and C++. Java is a wholesale 
        copy from C and C++. It retained the use of round brackets. We can't change 
        it to square brackets because that is not the syntax for functions. Consequently, 
        C++ and Java are similar. If you know one of them then moving on to the 
        other is relatively simple. Compile the above program using javac. More 
        errors! The error says: ';' expected.</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java<br>
        zzz.java:5: ';' expected.<br>
        resize(300,40)<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>When we see the ')' of the function, we know that the function is over. 
        But nothing seems obvious to the Java compiler. It requires us to put 
        a semicolon at the end of the statement. Carriage returns don't matter 
        but semicolons are a must. But why semicolon, why not dots? The developers 
        of Java were asked to choose a character that would indicate the end of 
        a statement. Since they couldn't agree on a common character they decided 
        to use their grandma's recipie- They did &quot;eenie,meenie,mina,mo&quot; 
        and their finger was pointing at the semicolon and hence they decided 
        on the semicolon! You see RULES are RULES... C requires semicolons, so 
        does C++ and Java uses them too. </p>
      <p>Make your program error free by putting a semicolon after resize, just 
        as we have done in the following program. Execute it and see the window 
        size change. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init()<br>
        {<br>
        resize(300,40);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>All code in Java must be written within functions. Hence we say that 
        a class is a collection of functions. Here we haven't put the code of 
        resize, instead we have given it the parameters it requires and then put 
        the semicolon. By doing so, we are calling the resize function. The code 
        within this function accepted the values and did the needful to resize 
        the window.</p>
      <p>Thus, you can call a function by specifying the function name, including 
        the parameters and ending it with a semicolon. </p>
      <p>We didn't explain something in the earlier example and that is the function 
        init. Now is the time for it. We will also tell you what the words void 
        and return mean. We created the function by naming the function init and 
        preceded it with the word void. Void means nothing. Here, void is the 
        return type. Return type indicates the type of value the function will 
        return. That means a function can return a number or a string or something 
        else entirely. So, what we are trying to say is that since the init function 
        is preceded with the word void it is not returning any value. It is of 
        significance to note that functions may or may not return values. </p>
      <p>In our program, we have the words public and void preceding the function 
        name. To understand this, delete the word public. Your program should 
        look as follows: </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        void init()<br>
        {<br>
        resize(100,400);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>Run it and you will surely see an error.</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>zzz.java:3: The method void init() declared in class zzz cannot override 
        the method of the same signature declared in class java.applet.Applet.The 
        access modifier is made more restrictive.<br>
        void init()<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>The error clearly indicates that there is a function/method called init 
        in java.applet.Applet and we haven't written it in the way it should have 
        been in the class zzz. The init in Applet has the word public and hence 
        we have to make it public too. Rules... remember? Now, public has to be 
        called something, so why not call it a modifier. If there is a function 
        with the same name in the class from which you are borrowing, they both 
        have to have the same modifiers, otherwise, you can't override it.</p>
      <p>Here, we have created a function called init. We've created it because 
        we are using the open and close curly braces {}. Then we are calling a 
        function called resize(). The difference between creating and calling 
        a function is that you call a function using round brackets () and end 
        with a semicolon but you create a function using curly braces {}. </p>
      <p>We must write the word public in front of init() or else others will 
        not be able to use it or call it and also because of the earlier error. 
        You probably noticed that init(), though it is a function, doesn't have 
        a semi-colon(;) following it. This is because when we call a function 
        we put a semicolon whereas when we create a function we do not. Here we 
        are creating a function called init(). </p>
      <p>Why do we have to create a function called init? This is because when 
        the appletviewer starts up, it calls a function called init. If we have 
        it in our code within the zzz class then our init() gets called, otherwise, 
        the one from java.applet.Applet gets executed. In our earlier program, 
        when we did not include 'extends java.applet.Applet' we got an error. 
        This was because one of the functions appletviewer calls is init().</p>
      <p>If you were to replace the small 'i' in init() with a capital 'I', then 
        the appletviewer will call the init code in Applet and that code doesn't 
        do anything. As you can see Case matters. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        void Init()<br>
        {<br>
        resize(100,400);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>We will now extend our definition of a class by saying that a class is 
        a collection of functions and within functions you can call other functions. 
      </p>
      <p>Let us quickly summarize what we have just learnt. </p>
      <p>The appletviewer or any java enabled browser calls init(). Since we included 
        the code of init() in zzz, our function was called. From our function 
        init(), we called another function, resize, which changes the size of 
        the window. The code of resize is in java.applet.Applet. So we now know 
        how to call and create a function.</p>
      <p>Let's go one step further and take a look at the next program. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init ()<br>
        {<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot;);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>Delete the resize function and instead call another function System.out.println. 
        This function takes one parameter, which in this example is hi. Unlike 
        numbers, strings must be enclosed within double quotes. </p>
      <p>On running this program neither javac nor the appletviewer will complain. 
        But nothing gets displayed in the applet window either. Close the window 
        and go back to dos, you will see hi displayed on the screen. </p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>hi</p>
      <p>System.out.println is a function with a long name. It is like resize. 
        The function ends with a semicolon indicating that we are calling this 
        function. The resize function can be called as it is because it is found 
        in java.applet.Applet which is a class made available to us. System.out.println 
        is also a function which is given to us by Java and hence using it will 
        not result in any error. This function takes a string as a parameter.</p>
      <p>The next program says System.out.println (&quot;bye&quot;+ii); it gives 
        you an error saying that it does not know what ii is. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init ()<br>
        {<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;bye&quot;+ii);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>zzz.java:5: Undefined variable: ii<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;bye&quot;+ii);<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>We will now introduce the concept of variables, an integral part of computer 
        programming.<br>
        zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init()<br>
        {<br>
        int ii;<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;bye&quot;+ii);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        This program includes int ii; ii is a variable that looks like an int. 
        int is the short form for integer. int is a class just like Applet or 
        zzz and is one which the java compiler knows. All variables are stored 
        in memory, they are words that hold or store a value. To be able to refer 
        to a vaiable, you have to give it a name. In our program, we have named 
        the variable ii. </p>
      <p>Now that the variable has been created it must be given a value otherwise 
        you see the following error..</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java<br>
        zzz.java:6: Variable ii may not have been initialized.<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;bye&quot;+ii);<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>So we give the variable ii a value, 10 . <br>
        zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init ()<br>
        {<br>
        int ii;<br>
        ii=10;<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot; + ii);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>hi10</p>
      <p>What about the '+' sign? The '+' sign enables you to display the string 
        'hi' along with the value of the variable ii. Hence the program displays 
        hi10. The '+' here does not mean add, it means concatenate. Have you been 
        wondering why these named memory locations are called variables? They 
        are called variables because their values can vary. <br>
        The next program makes it clear as to why variables are called variables. 
      </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init () <br>
        {<br>
        int ii;<br>
        ii=10;<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot; + ii);<br>
        ii=20;<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot; + ii);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>hi10<br>
        hi20</p>
      <p>In this program, ii is assigned a value 10 initially. The first println 
        displays hi10. Then the value of ii is changed to 20. The second println 
        prints out hi20. <br>
        zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init () <br>
        {<br>
        int ii;<br>
        ii=10;<br>
        System.out.println(ii);<br>
        ii= ii +20;<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot; + ii);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java<br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html<br>
        10<br>
        30</p>
      <p>In the above program, initially ii has a value 10. println prints the 
        value of ii ,which is 10. Thereafter, we have ii= ii+20. Looks confusing, 
        isn't it! Whenever you see '=', always start by looking to the right of 
        the sign. On the right we have ii+20. You know that ii has a value 10, 
        so this statement is read as 10+20. This evaluates to 30 and is given 
        to the variable on the left side of the '=' sign i.e. ii. So the value 
        30 is stored in ii. println will now display 30.</p>
      <p>Thus, a variable is a word in which you store a value and its value can 
        change. Where ever you use a variable you can use a number and wherever 
        you use a number you can replace it with a variable.</p>
      <p>int is commonly referred to as a datatype but in Java it is called a 
        class. zzz is also a class. A class can now be redefined as a collection 
        of variables and functions. </p>
      <p>Just as we had created our own function init, we create pqr. This function 
        contains the line System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot;); Hence when pqr is 
        called from init, hi is displayed. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init ()<br>
        {<br>
        pqr();<br>
        }<br>
        public void pqr()<br>
        {<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot;);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>hi</p>
      <p>We now create one more function named xyz. We are now calling the function 
        xyz from the function pqr.</p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init ()<br>
        {<br>
        pqr();<br>
        }</p>
      <p>public void pqr()<br>
        {<br>
        xyz();<br>
        }<br>
        public void xyz()<br>
        {<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;In xyz&quot;);<br>
        }</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>In xyz</p>
      <p>In the above program, the pqr function is calling the function xyz. The 
        xyz function has a println, which displays &quot;In xyz&quot;. </p>
      <p>But you cannot have xyz call pqr as it will go into an indefinite loop 
        . </p>
      <p>Our next program passes a value to the function pqr. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init ()<br>
        {<br>
        pqr(200);<br>
        }<br>
        public void pqr(int z)<br>
        {<br>
        System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot;+z);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;appletviewer a.html</p>
      <p>hi200</p>
      <p>This program shows how parameters or values are passed to functions. 
        Here, the value 200 is being passed to the function pqr. The function 
        pqr receives it in int z. What is z? It looks like an int. Actually, we 
        are creating a variable called z, which will store the value passed to 
        pqr. Variables can be called by any name. Earlier we used a variable ii 
        and now we are using z. You could have called it 'x', the choice is yours! 
        z is also called a parameter. System.out.println is used to display the 
        value. </p>
      <p>Our next program has a function called paint. It takes a value Graphics 
        g. Just like the function pqr had a parameter z that looked like int, 
        here g is a parameter which looks like Graphics. To put it a little more 
        technically, we can say that paint and pqr are both called with one parameter. 
      </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {</p>
      <p>System.out.println(&quot;hi&quot;);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>We did not create Graphics; it is available to us free. That's what we 
        are assuming. Run javac and you will get an error.<br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>zzz.java:3: Class Graphics not found.<br>
        public void paint ( Graphics g)<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>You have already come across similar errors. The name is not Graphics; 
        it is java.awt.Graphics. The best way to learn a language is to speak 
        it! Speak big names! Write big names! Change Graphics to java.awt.Graphics 
        and you don't get an error, everything seems fine, but you don't see anything 
        on the screen either. <br>
        zzz.java<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void paint ( java.awt.Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>When it comes to speaking, we do so readily but most of us shirk writing. 
        Keeping that in mind, we will use Graphics to make it concise but will 
        also introduce a new statement as in import java.awt.* with a semicolon<br>
        zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends java.applet.Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void paint ( Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        '*' implies everything. Note that the semicolon is a part of its syntax. 
        Import does a search and a replace. Since writing the entire class name 
        is tedious, whenever it sees the name of a class it adds java.awt. So 
        it adds java.awt to every classname that gives an error. It will not add 
        to java.applet.Applet because it didn't give an error. So Graphics automatically 
        becomes java.awt.Graphics. Let's do the same thing for Applet. So we now 
        have two imports. <br>
        zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void paint ( Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>The first thing that the compiler does is tries Applet as java.awt.Applet. 
        It realizes that it still gives an error. It then tries as java.applet.Applet 
        and realizes that the error is removed. Basically, the order doesn't matter. 
        If you prefer using short names, then you will have to use the import 
        statements. </p>
      <p>Thus, you could write the longest of programs without using the word 
        import. But the only problem is that your hands will get very tired. Java 
        gave us a problem by giving us long names but at the same time provided 
        a solution to it by giving the import statement. </p>
      <p>In the next example, we have included two import functions and a single 
        paint function. The paint function calls g.drawString. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void paint ( Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi&quot;);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>As of now, we will ignore what the dot in drawString really means. With 
        the knowledge you have already gathered, it must be clear to you that 
        drawString is a function ( ) and ends with a semicolon. Thus, in effect, 
        we are calling a function. On running the program, you will get an error 
        saying 'drawString has wrong number of arguments'. </p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>zzz.java:7: Wrong number of arguments in method.<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi&quot;);<br>
        ^<br>
        1 error</p>
      <p>Arguments and parameters are words that can be used interchangeably. 
        Similarly, functions are analogous to methods. </p>
      <p>This is why people like programming in Java. You are like a child and 
        Java the mother. You make a mistake and you get a spanking! Drawstring 
        must be called with a certain number of parameters. Goof up and you get 
        errors!<br>
        <br>
        If you are feeling sleepy and you are not drinking coffee, you can't write 
        code in Java ;-) </p>
      <p>Let's analyze the reason behind the error. In order to draw a string 
        you must state at what location on the screen the string is to be displayed. 
        That would mean providing 3 parameters. The first is the string followed 
        by the x and the y coordinates. Rewrite this function with the new set

      <p><b>NOTE:</b> In dos, the character-based screen is divided into 80 characters 
        and 25 lines. In a graphical user interface, the screen is divided into 
        dots called pixels. It is commonly referred to as resolutions. The costlier 
        the monitor and the video card, the better the resolution!! The resize 
        function and the width and height attributes in the tag applet need their 
        parameters to be pixels . </p>
      <p>Run the appletviewer. You will see Hi displayed at 5, 50 i.e. (x, y) 
        in the applet window. </p>
      <p>The paint function gets called every time Windows wants to redraw the 
        screen and we can't tell in advance how many times that is going to happen.<br>

      <p>Once again, just to revise the concept of variables, use int ii and initialize 
        ii to 5. In the drawString, instead of giving 5, put ii. This is the first 
        use of a variable; you can place it wherever there is a number. </p>
      <p>In the next example, as a re-revision, we have put two drawStrings and 
        changed ii by saying ii = ii + 20 and given drawString again.<br>

        2 errors</p>
      <p>You get these errors because variables in one function are not accessible 
        in another function. Variables, by default, are local. Local variables 
        are only available to the function in which you have created them. So 
        ii is available only in init. It has a short life. It is alive only between 
        the '{' and the '}' brackets. If you want all functions in a class to 
        access the variable, the only option is to place it outside the function.

        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p><br>
        A variable when placed outside the function is called a public variable. 
        Every function in the class can access a public variable. Hence we don't 
        get any errors in the above program. The init function changes the value 
        of ii to 100. Paint changes it to 5. Finally, what gets displayed is the 
        last one and that is 5. So you see Hi on the top of the screen at 5,50 
        and not at 100,50. If you remove the line ii=5 from paint then ii will 
        retain the value 100.</p>
      <p>There is a subtle difference between System.out.println and drawString 
        in terms of displaying a variable with a string. The only difference is 
        that println draws in the dos box and drawString writes in your graphics 
        screen. In the following program, we have used the same '+' and displayed 
        the value of the variable with hi. A variable can be used constantly. 
        That means you can use it multiple times on the same line or in the same 
        function. This program outputs Hi5 on top of the screen at 5,50.</p>

        public variables. Again, we have declared ii as a public variable. </p>

        }</p>
      <p>In init, the variable ii is initialized to a value 20. Then the function 
        pqr is called. pqr reinitializes ii to 80. Hence in paint, the value displayed 
        with Hi is 80. </p>
      <p>In the next example, we will pass the public variable ii as a parameter 
        to the function pqr()</p>

        ii = jj + 20; <br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>The public variable ii is initialized to 40 by init. Then pqr is called 
        with one parameter i.e. ii. In the pqr function, the value of ii, which 
        is 40, is stored in jj. jj + 20 increases the value to 60 which is assigned 
        to ii. In paint, ii will display its value as 60. A program can be made 
        as complicated as you like. But if we had replaced the line ii = jj + 
        20 with jj = ii + 50 , then changing jj does not change ii.<br>

        }</p>
      <p><br>
        This program is getting very interesting! ii is a public variable available 
        to all. Instead of passing ii as a parameter to the pqr function, we say 
        ii=pqr();. Here pqr is a function, which is public. If you notice, instead 
        of void, this function returns an int. Previously, we used void, implying 
        that the function did not return a value. The pqr function now returns 
        80. The return value of pqr is stored in ii. It returns a value using 
        the statement return 80. 80 is the value that will be given to ii. This 
        is how functions return values. By saying return 80 all that happens is 
        that pqr() gets replaced by 80, the return value.</p>

      <p>In the above program, we have added one more function named mouseDown. 
        This function returns a boolean value. Boolean is a logical value, either 
        true or false. mouseDown is called with 3 parameters; Event e, int x1 
        and int y1 are the three parameters. x1 and y1 are two variables of type 
        int and e looks like Event. On compiling the program, you will get the 
        following error: <br>
        C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>zzz.java:14: Return required at end of boolean mouseDown(java.awt.Event,

        Note: zzz.java uses or overrides a deprecated API. Recompile with &quot;-deprecation 
        &quot; for details.<br>
        1 error, 1 warning</p>
      <p>Here, mouseDown returns a boolean, but in our code we have no return 
        statement with a true or a false, hence the error. If a function has a 
        return value other than void then it must return a value. You can return 
        either true or false, it doesn't really matter, as long as you return 
        a boolean value. </p>
      <p>Let's look at another version of this example.<br>
        zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int x,y;<br>
        public void init()<br>
        {<br>
        x = 10 ; y = 20;<br>
        }<br>
        public void paint ( Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;, x , y);<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        x = x1 ; y = y1;<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        In this example, the mouseDown function returns true. Alternatively, you 
        can return false instead of true. As long as you return a boolean value, 
        your program will work fine. In this program, it doesn't matter whether 
        you return true or false but in other cases it may matter as to what mouseDown 
        returns. x and y are two public variables. You can create them separately 
        by saying int x; int y; But when you want to create 20 variables it is 
        easier saying int x,y,z,a,b,... all at a stretch. It is an alternative 
        method, where we use ',' as a separator.</p>
      <p>The compiler will display a warning which can be ignored.<br>
        <br>
        The init function initializes x and y to 10 and 20 respectively. g.drawString 
        takes the values 10 and 20 for x and y. Now run your program using the 
        appletviewer.</p>
      <p>Click with the mouse in the window. Stop clicking! As of now nothing 
        happens. Now minimize the window and then maximize it. Surprisingly, you 
        see hi at the location where you clicked or where you last clicked.</p>
      <p>Let's understand what this means.</p>
      <p>The mouseclick in the window was trapped by the mouseDown function. The 
        parameters x1 and y1 tell you where the mouse was clicked. e, which is 
        an object that looks like Event, tells us how we clicked. How we clicked? 
        Aren't all mouse clicks the same? Actually, they aren't because not only 
        can we click, but we can click with the control key or the shift key depressed 
        and so on. Event will give us information as to whether these keys were 
        pressed while we clicked. We will not go into further details regarding 
        this as ours is but a simple click.</p>
      <p>Before the mouseDown returns true, x and y are initialized to x1 and 
        y1, which represent the location where the mouse was clicked. They are 
        public variables and are thus accessible from within the mouseDown function 
        too. On minimizing and maximizing the window, paint gets called with the 
        new values. Hence you see hi at a different position; the position where 
        you clicked.</p>
      <p>Unless the window is not minimized and maximized, the paint function 
        doesn't get called. It gets called either at the start or when the window 
        has to be redrawn. To demonstrate this, we will now call paint through 
        another function called repaint which exists in the Applet class. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>

        import java.applet.*;<br>

        int x,y;<br>
        public void init()<br>
        {<br>
        x = 10 ; y = 20;<br>
        }<br>
        public void paint ( Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;, x , y);<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        x = x1 ; y = y1;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>The repaint function calls paint and hence the 'hi' follows the mouse 
        click. Make sure that every time you make changes to your code, you compile 
        it again using javac, and then run the appletviewer. </p>

        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>In the above program, the value of ii increases every time the function 
        paint gets called. i++ can also be written as i=i+1. When you run the 
        program, initially the value of the variable will be 1 because paint gets 
        called once. When you minimize and maximize the window, paint gets called. 
        Now click the restore button to restore the window back to its original 
        size. Now paint gets called twice. We cannot really decide when and who 
        calls paint. Whenever Microsoft Windows realizes that your window needs 
        to be redrawn, it calls paint. It can call paint once or it can call paint 
        20 times. The important point to note is that it is only through paint 
        that you can write to the screen. </p>

        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>In the above program, each time you click in the window, repaint gets 
        called. But before doing that, the value of ii is incremented by 1. ii 
        is a public variable hence you see the value change.</p>
      <p>Every program should have some sort of intelligence built into it. A 
        programming language offers features that make the program more intelligent 
        and more generic. Our program doesn't have such features as yet. This 
        is because we haven't given it the ability to decide whether a certain 
        piece of code should be executed or not. We will use the next program 
        to demonstrate this. <br>

      <p>In this program, we have included the word 'if' followed by true in round 
        brackets. When you run this program, you realize that it's output is no 
        different from that of the previous program. </p>
      <p>Now change the 'true' to 'false' as shown below. You will observe that 
        g.drawString doesn't get called at all. You will see a blank screen.</p>
      <p><br>
        zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( false )<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>Let's understand the reason behind it. The if statement lets you include 
        decision making in your program. It decides whether to execute the next 
        line or not. When the if statement evaluates to true, it executes the 
        next line. When it evaluates to false, the next line is skipped. This 
        program now has the ability to either execute or not execute a piece of 
        code. </p>
      <p>The following program will make this concept clearer.</p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ii &gt;= 3 )<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>ii is a variable which increments by 1 when you click in the window. 
        The mouseDown function calls repaint which inturn calls paint. In paint, 
        the if condition checks whether the value of ii is greater than or equal 
        to 3. When you click within the window for the first time, the value of 
        ii will be 1, so the if condition is now read as (1 &gt;=3). Since the 
        condition is false, the if statement becomes if (false). As we have seen 
        in the earlier program, if the if statement evaluates to false, it ignores 
        the next line. So hi is not displayed on the screen. The third click will 
        initialize ii to 3. Since 3 = 3, the if condition becomes true and hi 
        is displayed along with 3 on the screen. </p>
      <p>This is how, depending on certain conditions, you can decide whether 
        code should be called or not.</p>
      <p>To understand &gt; or &lt; try out the next program. &gt; and + - * are 
        all called operators.<br>
        zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        public void init()<br>
        {<br>
        Sysetm.ou.println(3&gt;8);<br>
        Sysetm.ou.println(8&gt;3);<br>
        } <br>
        }</p>
      <p>In the next program, after the if statement, two drawString functions 
        are called and passed Hi and Bye respectively.<br>
        zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ii &gt;= 3 )<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Bye &quot;+ii,5,100);<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>Here, each time you click in the window Bye gets displayed on the screen 
        but Hi gets displayed only after the 3rd click. This implies that the 
        if condition works only for the next line i.e. it either ignores or executes 
        the next line. The rest of the code is beyond its control. If you want 
        multiple statements to be affected by the if statement use curly braces 
        '{}'. Now include both the drawString functions within curly braces. <br>
        zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ii &gt;= 3 )<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Bye &quot;+ii,5,100);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>In this program, after the third click both the drawStrings get executed. 
        Both 'Hi' and 'Bye' are displayed only after the third click.</p>
      <p>You can try the same code with different operators like &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, 
        &gt;= </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>if (i &gt;3) , if (i&lt;3), if(i &lt;=3), if (i &gt;=3)</p>
      <p>Let's try this program using the '=' operator.</p>
      <p>if( ii = 3 )</p>
      <p>This will give you an error.</p>
      <p>C:\javaprg&gt;javac zzz.java</p>
      <p>zzz.java:8: Incompatible type for if. Can't convert int to boolean.<br>
        if ( ii = 3 )<br>
        ^<br>
        Note: zzz.java uses or overrides a deprecated API. Recompile with &quot;-deprecation 
        &quot; for details.<br>
        1 error, 1 warning</p>
      <p>This results in an error because a condition should result in a logical 
        value i.e. it must be a boolean value. Here '=' is assigning a value 3 
        to ii, it is not </p>
      <p>asking whether ii is equal to 3 or not. The '=' attempts to assign ii 
        a new value.</p>
      <p>Using '==' solves this problem. The if statement now becomes if (ii == 
        3). When you run the program, click slowly because the if condition will 
        evaluate to true only once. </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ii == 3 )<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Bye &quot;+ii,5,100);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>The '==' compares ii with a certain value. You may not want a certain 
        piece of code to be executed if the variable meets a certain value. In 
        such a case use !=, the 'not equal to' operator. The following program 
        supports this statement.</p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ii != 3 )<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Bye &quot;+ii,5,100);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>The drawString functions are called for all values of ii except 3. The 
        next program reveals how a condition can be reversed.</p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ! ( ii &gt;= 3) )<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Bye &quot;+ii,5,100);<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>'!' allows you to negate a condition. !( ii &gt;= 3), is the same as 
        (ii &lt; 3). You can use two different approaches to do the same thing, 
        either say if (ii &lt; 3) or if (! ( ii&gt;=3)).</p>
      <p>In the previous examples, if the condition was true, code was executed 
        and when false, nothing happened. You probably felt limited, because it 
        only lets you execute a statement when the condition is true. The next 
        example takes care of this, showing us how to use an else with our if. 
        The additional else statement will execute the code following it only 
        when the if condition evaluates to false.</p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ii &lt;= 3)<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Hi &quot;+ii,5,50);<br>
        else<br>
        g.drawString(&quot;Bye &quot;+ii,5,20);<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        ii++;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>
        If the condition ii &lt;= 3 evaluates to true then Hi will be displayed, 
        otherwise, Bye will be displayed. </p>
      <p>The next program will show you how you can use the if statement intelligently. 
      </p>
      <p>zzz.java<br>
        import java.awt.*;<br>
        import java.applet.*;<br>
        public class zzz extends Applet<br>
        {<br>
        int ii = 0;int a,b,c,d;<br>
        public void paint (Graphics g)<br>
        {<br>
        g.drawLine(a,b,c,d);<br>
        }<br>
        public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x1 , int y1)<br>
        {<br>
        if ( ii == 0)<br>
        {<br>
        a = x1; b = y1;<br>
        ii = 1;<br>
        }<br>
        else<br>
        {<br>
        c = x1 ; d = y1;<br>
        ii = 0;<br>
        repaint();<br>
        }<br>
        return true;<br>
        }<br>
        }</p>
      <p>In this program, the variable ii is initialized to 0. The mouseDown function 
        facilitates the trapping of the mouse click. The if condition is used 
        in the mouseDown function. If the condition evaluates to true i.e. if 
        ii is equal to 0, the click positions which are stored in x1 and y1 are 
        assigned to the public variables a and b respectively. After that, ii 
        is initialized to 1. With the second click the code for else is called. 
        The click positions are given to a different set of public variables i.e. 
        c and d. ii is then reinitialized to 0. Then the repaint() indirectly 
        calls paint. The paint function calls the drawLine function which belongs 
        to the Graphics class. drawLine takes 4 parameters, the first two determine 
        where the line begins and the next two fix the end of the line.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, the first click calls code initializing the variables 
        a and b. With the second click the variables c and d are initialized. 
        Thus, clicking twice draws a line between the two clicks. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Conclusion</font></b></p>
      <p>In this chapter, we have seen how Java has taken the entire on-line world 
        by storm. We have seen how Java applets are embedded in the HTML pages. 
        We showed you variations of programs right from a simple Java applet to 
        more complex ones. This was done using various combinations of operators 
        in the if statement and some basic functions. These together with the 
        concept of objects and classes were used to introduce to you the concept 
        of object-oriented programming and what Java as a programming language 
        has in store for us.<br>
