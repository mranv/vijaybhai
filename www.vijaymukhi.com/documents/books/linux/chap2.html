<P>gcc = the wrapper</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;Uptil now, we've really not taught you much about invoking the GNU C Compiler. All we've taught you to do is compile programs without any switches except -o to name the output file, like so...</P>
<P>gcc a.c -o a</P>
<P>As you've already seen, this will create an executable file name 'a', which you run by typing './a' at the prompt. In this chapter, we'll explore the different switches that gcc recognizes their effects on the compilation process. We'll also explain (to some degree) what happens when you say 'gcc a.c'.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Header Files</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;First, let's talk about header files in a little more detail. If you remember in Chapter 1 of this book, we introduced the concept of header files. We had you run a program where you used the structure 'FILE' and then we told you to include the header file stdio.h as it had resulted in an error. This leads us to tell you a little something about the preprocessor.</P>
<P>We'll now examine header files in a little more detail...</P>
<P>Create a new subdirectory called 'new' with these two files</P>
</FONT><PRE>a.c
#include "a.h"
main()
{
printf("hi..%d\n",AA);
}
a.h
#define AA 100
#gcc a.c -o a
#./a
hi..100
&nbsp;</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>In the file a.c, we have included a header file named 'a.h'. The reason we've used</P>
<P>#include "a.h"</P>
<P>instead of </P>
<P>#include &lt;a.h&gt;</P>
<P>is because 'a.h' is in the current directory. Only if the header file is part of the standard set supplied with GCC will the &lt;&gt;'s be used.</P>
<P>The file 'a.h' contains the <I>hash define</I> AA which is equal to 100. So wherever we use AA in the program, it will be replaced by 100. This is called a <B><I>macro</B></I> and can be very useful. For example, in many production programs, you'd use a macro in place of a fixed number. In this way, if you had to change the value of the number, all you'd have to do is edit one hash define, instead of 'search and replacing you're way through a million files. Macros, by convention, are always in uppercase. This makes it easier for the programmer to differentiate between them and variables when reading the program.</P>
<P>Now let's see what happens when you pass this file to gcc.</P>
<P>When a file is passed to gcc, it goes through 4 basic processes. The first stage is the preprocessor stage, which we discussed in Chapter 1. The preprocessor goes through your .c files and examines all statements starting with '#'. When it spots a statement like #include "a.h", it picks up the file and <I>adds</I> it to the current .c file. So if in the previous example, 'a.c' was 5 lines long and 'a.h' was 100 lines long, then after the merge, 'a.c' would end up being 105 lines long. </P>
<P>Now the preprocessor searches for and replaces all the macros that it can find. Once all the replacements are complete, the compiler is called in and given the file.</P>
<P>Now this is <I>very important</I>, so listen carefully. The file that the compiler sees is <B><I>not</B></I> the original 'a.c'. It sees a modified 'a.c' with all the lines from 'a.h' added and the macros replaced with their correct values. This can lead to some serious problems if the header file contains any errors. It is possible to have macros that behave like simple functions. If there is an error in one of these, it can lead to a lot of confusion! The compiler doesn't know about header files, so when it sees an error, it will report the line number of the file it sees. When you check it up in the original 'a.c', you'll land up on an entirely innocent line! </P>
<P>If you have no statements beginning with '#' in your program, the preprocessor does nothing.</P>
<P>By convention a '.c' file contains a C program and a file with a '.i' extension is a preprocessed file and a file with a '.s' extension is an assembler file. Under gcc, the compiler outputs an assembler file. This file is then passed to the assembler which converts the file into an object file ('.o' extension). This object file is then passed to the linker who converts it into an executable binary.</P>
<P>Type this in at the prompt.</P>
<P>gcc -save-temps a.c</P>
<P>These switchs tell gcc to keep the temporary files it creates. Use ls to view the contents of the directory.</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You'll notice that the .c file has been converted into a.i file by the preprocessor. The compiler then converted the .i file to a .s file. This file is passed to the assembler which then outputs a .o file that is converted into the executable a.out (the default name) by the linker.</P>
<P>To verify, cat through a.i and you can tell that the preprocessors gone through the header file. Notice that the macro AA does not show up. Instead, we have the number 100 placed in the appropriate location. I'll say this once more, the compiler doesn't know of or see any # statements, the preprocessor takes care of all that.</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Cat'ting the other two files will only show gibberish, but the file a.out is executable and saying './a.out' at the prompt will run the program.</P>
<P>#./a.out</P>
<P>hi..100</P>
<P>The program 'gcc' is what's called a driver (or maybe wrapper?) . It doesn't do anything itself, instead it calls other programs one after the other and passes them the correct parameters and switches.</P>
<P>Why use a driver program instead of calling the preprocessor, compiler, assembler and linker separately? One reason is convenience. The other is portability. The program 'gcc' provides us with a large number of portable switches that affect the behavior of the various programs called. This ensures that your program will compile correctly on various platforms. </P>
<P>The reason we're going into the grisly details is to explain the inner workings of gcc and to help you understand the process by which executables are produced.</P>
<P>Let's start working backwards. We'll first examine the linker.</P>
<P>#gcc -c a.c</P>
<P>&nbsp;The -c switch tells gcc not to link the file. So we end up with the file 'a.o'. To perform the final step and link the file, we say</P>
</FONT><PRE>#ld a.o -o a
ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 08048074
a.o: In function `main':
a.o(.text+0x9): undefined reference to `printf'
&nbsp;</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>This calls the linker 'ld' and tells it to link 'a.o' and create the executable file 'a'. So all that gcc has been doing all this time is calling 'ld' with the -o switch.</P>
<P>There seems to be a problem here though. We get one warning and one error. We're using the standard function printf(), which hasn't been defined in our C program. The code for this function and many others is to be found in the file libc.so in the directory /usr/lib.</P>
</FONT><PRE>ls -l /usr/lib/libc.so
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 178 Sep 20 14:42 /usr/lib/libc.so</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Since the code for printf() is not present in our .c file, we have to tell 'ld' where to find it.</P>
</FONT><PRE>ld a.o -o a /usr/lib/libc.so</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>We could instead have said </P>
<P>ld -o a a.o -lc</P>
<P>which ends up doing the same thing. When you use -lc, the -l is replaced with 'lib' and '.so' is added after 'c'. So we end up with 'libc.so'. 'ld' looks into /lib and /usr/lib by default anyway, so the code for printf() will be picked up. </P>
<P>Just another way to do the same thing.</P>
<P>Now type in </P>
<P>./a</P>
<P>at the prompt and see the result. Nope, we're not there yet. Bash responds to our attempt to run 'a' by replying that there's no such file or directory to be found. A simple 'ls' proves Bash wrong, 'a' does exist, but Bash refuses to run it.</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>#./a</P>
<P>bash: ./a: No such file or directory</P>
<P>This really isn't Bash's fault. Bash is simply a shell, an interface to the computer. It doesn't know how to load and run executables. It needs the services of the designated loader for ELF files, ld-linux.so.2, which is to be found in the /lib directory. The information about which loader to call is added to the executable when it's being linked. The linker has to be explicitly told which loader to use. So we should actually link up our program like this.</P>
<P>#ld -o a a.o -lc -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2</P>
<P>Type in </P>
<P>./a </P>

#</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>...and prompt throws up all over itself.</P>
<P>We'll need to dig deeper into the inner workings of our program to figure this one out. </P>
<P>When we run our program, main() isn't the first bit of code to be called. Instead, the <I>startup code</I> executes first. Think back to when we were doing argc and argv[] for the first time. We'd said then that they had been created by Linux and placed on the stack.</P>
<P>We lied. </P>
<P>And it's not going to be the last time, you can count on that!</P>
<P>It's actually the startup code that carries out this function. Once it's done with all it has to do, it calls main(). Now, we have to tell 'ld' where main() is. Actually, the first executable line of code in a program is labeled '_start' by convention. We have to tell 'ld' to use main() as the '_start' of our program. This gets rid of that warning about the absence of '_start' and should ensure that our program runs smoothly.</P>
<P>Simply add the switch -e followed by the name of the function to use as '_start' and we're done. </P>
</FONT><PRE>#ld -o a a.o -lc -e main -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2
#./a
hi..100</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Segmentation fault (core dumped)</P>
<P>#</P>
<P>Hmmmm, the problem persists.</P>
<P>Well, since we've taken care of the startup, let's tackle the shutdown. We need to add the function exit() to our program to tell Linux that we're through. We pass one parameter to exit(), a number which may have some predefined meaning. This is useful if you're creating a program to be used by shell scripts. They can use the exit value to figure out if program failed, or if it carried out its function successfully. For example, according to convention, an exit value of 0 stands for success and anything else usually implies that an error occurred.</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Check the exit value by echoing the value of $?, a special shell variable which holds the last returned value. We say</P>
</FONT><PRE>./a;echo $?</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>The semicolon in the middle tells Bash to finish with the first command and then run the second. We get a 10, just as we should.</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>By using -D, we can define macros at compiler time. This can be really useful for tasks like debugging. Depending on the value passed to key macros here, programs could behave in different ways. A concrete example of this is the Apache web server. When compiling Apache, we use -D to tell Apache where to look for its configuration files. </P>
<P>Besides user defined macros, there are several macros which come built in with GCC. For example, there is _GNUC__MINOR_. </P>
</FONT><PRE>b.c
main()
{
printf("hi....%d\n",__GNUC_MINOR__);
}
#gcc b.c
./a.out
hi....91</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>91 is the minor version number of GCC. Notice that it's the same as seen in the pathname for 'cpp'(usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/). 2 is the major version number and 91 is the minor version number.</P>
<P>Other macros are created without any value associated with them, for example, 'linux'.</P>
</FONT><PRE>b.c
#ifdef linux
#error "1"
#endif
main()
{
}
gcc b.c
b.c:2: #error "1"</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>#ifdef is like the if() statement in C. We're saying that if the macro linux has been defined, flag an error. We mark the end of an #ifdef with a #endif. We can use this to figure out if our program is being compiled on Linux, or on some other platform. Whenever 'gcc' is run under Linux, it creates a macro named 'linux'. This can be used to conditionally compile your programs. Depending on what platform it's being compiled on, different parts of program would be compiled. Quite useful really.</P>
