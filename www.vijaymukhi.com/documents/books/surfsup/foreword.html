<p style='margin-left:2.5in;text-align:justify'><i>People believe that I am the
first Internet user in India. About ten years ago, when India did not have her
own service providers, like VSNL and MTNL, I used the services of E-World to log
on to the net. From that moment on, I knew that this was a technology that was
going to make waves in the communications and corporate world. At that time I
used to log on to the net to chat with fellow netizens in chat rooms that were
especially created for Indians to come and share their views on any subject
under the sun. Bharat Varsh, one such chat room had Indians from all over the
world coming together every week to discuss what was closest to their hearts. I
yet remember the time when I had spent hours on this chat room sharing my views
on the astonishing phenomenon of the Ganpati drinking milk. And of course, I
will never forget the last moments I had spent with my friends from across the
globe when E-World closed down. These were people whom I had never met in my
life, but with whom I shared a special bond. It was truly a nostalgic moment as
we bid each other good-bye, hoping to meet once again in cyber space. The
Internet had proved that there can be no barriers to communication. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style='margin-left:2.5in;text-align:justify'><i>One striking incident that
made me love the Internet even more was when I was able to get in touch with my
childhood friend from yester years. I was so overjoyed at receiving his mail
after a gap of 55 years. We had been separated during the partition of India
only to be reunited in cyber space. I am in India and he is in Pakistan, yet we
share an everlasting friendship. And none of this would have been possible if
it was not for the Internet technology. Yes, I can say that the Internet is
responsible for proving to me that friendships can survive distance and time.
This is what I adore the most about the net. It bridges the gap between people.
The world was already a small place. It has shrunk even further thanks to the
introduction of the Internet. There is no limit to communication on the net. We
started with simple email messages, progressed to attachments and chat modules
and now have facilities to send voice mails and video clippings.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style='margin-left:2.5in;text-align:justify'><i>Another facet about the
Internet that catches my attention is the astounding amount of information
available. There is so much knowledge available on the net that we need not
look any further. I myself use the net to access information about health care
and cures. And I firmly believe that each individual should be provided access
to this wealth of knowledge. India never had a computer culture like the one
that was prevalent in America. But we are slowly catching on. The net is
evolving at the speed of lightening and it is time that every person,
especially every Indian take advantage of this vast technology. I am extremely
happy that Vijay, Sejal and Shanta have written this book. It is a step toward
making those who are skeptical of using the net, shed their inhibitions and
just log on! Infact, I firmly believe that this book should be on the academic
curriculum of every school in India. It will provide children with the exposure
to a multi- dimensional technology at a young age. If I, at this later stage of
my life, can find the net so useful, I can only imagine the boundless utility it
can provide to the young and the enthusiastic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style='margin-left:2.5in;text-align:justify'><i>I am a Mac man. I don't
understand computer languages like C, C++ and Java. Yet I am an Internet freak.
And yet I get along so infamously well with a PC user like Vijay Mukhi. I
admire him for his teaching qualities. And I am glad that he is imparting so
much precious knowledge to eager students. We both share a love for the net and
this has made it possible for us to be such great friends. I am immensely happy
to be associated with this book. I know that the efforts of Vijay, Sejal and
Shanta will pay off. I am confident that their book will help millions of
Indians to start using the net. However, I must add that even as we use the
net, we must be careful not to abuse it. The Internet is a technology that must
be used wisely. And this book will show you how. <o:p></o:p></i></p>
