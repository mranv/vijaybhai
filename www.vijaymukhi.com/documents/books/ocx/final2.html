<H1>The Makings Of An OCX Container</H1>
<H2>Putting the OCX in it's place</H2>With <I>OLE</I> 1.0, only embedded objects 
were supported. This meant that all objects opened as separate windows. But it 
&nbsp;would be preferable to have the objects appear as a part of our 
application. The user should not be aware of the fact that he is dealing with 
two or more separate applications. This need &nbsp;was satisfied &nbsp;when 
in-place activation was introduced in <I>OLE</I> 2.0.<BR>With in-place 
activation, the server appears within the container window. This means that the 
server window is a child within &nbsp;the container window. Read my lips <I>"A 
child within the container window</I>".<BR>As explained earlier, <I>DoVerb()</I> 
is responsible for the <I>OCX</I> display. The first parameter to 
<I>DoVerb()</I> decides the nature of display. Hence, in the function 
<I>DoVerb()</I> in Progarm 1, replace the first parameter by 
<I>OLEIVERB_SHOW</I>. This indicates that the <I>OCX</I> should appear as an 
in-place active object. Sadly this doesn't happen.<BR>Earlier we had said that 
the <I>OLE</I> interface has no code. We have to add code to implement any and 
every feature that we require. We have provided no support for in-place 
activation, so how can we expect the <I>OCX</I> to be displayed in-place?<BR>Add 
code from Progarm 2 to Program 1. This provides the &nbsp;function 
implementations required for an <I>OCX</I> to appear in-place.<BR>

</PRE>Once again use <I>Insert Control...</I> sub-option place the <I>OCX</I> 
<B><I>Button</i></B> as an object within our container. This time the <I>OCX</I> 
will appear to be a part and &nbsp;parcel of our window. The <I>OCX</I> is now 
said to appear as an <I>in-place</I> active object.<BR><I>ObjCreate()</I> has 
been modified to facilitate in-place activation. The classes 
<I>MOleClientSite</I>, <I>MOleInPlaceFrame</I> and <I>MOleInPlaceSite</I> are 
our stand-ins for the interfaces <I>IOleClientSite</I>, <I>IOleInPlaceFrame</I> 
and <I>IOleInPlaceSite</I> respectively. We have created an &nbsp;instance of 
each in <I>ObjCreate()</I>.<BR>So far <I>we</I> have called functions in the 
<I>OCX</I>. We have asked &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> for information. In a similar 
fashion, the <I>OCX</I> also wants to know more about the container. To do so, 
it requires a pointer from the container. <BR>The container has to use the 
<I>IOleObject</I> function <I>SetClientSite()</I> to pass it's 
<I>IOleClientSite</I> pointer to the <I>OCX</I>. Thus, we pass the 
<I>MOleClientSite</I> pointer to <I>SetClientSite()</I> after suitable casting. 
The <I>OCX</I> on receiving the pointer through <I>SetClientSite()</I> will use 
it to determine if the container supports in-place editing by asking for an 
<I>IOleInPlaceSite</I> pointer. This it does by calling <I>QueryInterface()</I> 
of <I>MOleClientSite</I> with <I>IID_IOleInPlaceSite.</I>The <I>OCX</I> uses the 
<I>MOleInPlaceSite</I> pointer passed &nbsp;to it to call two functions from 
this interface: <I>GetWindow()</I> and <I>GetWindowContext()</I>. If the 
<I>OCX</I> is to appear in-place within the container, then it needs to know the 
handle &nbsp;to the parent window. In the function <I>GetWindow()</I>, we pass 
&nbsp;a pointer &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;handle of the container's window 
&nbsp;back &nbsp;to &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I>.<BR>It &nbsp;is the function 
<I>GetWindowContext()</I> that makes crucial information regarding the container 
available to the <I>OCX</I>. It has five parameters. The container is expected 
to pass the address of it's <I>IOleInPlaceFrame</I> object to the <I>OCX</I> 
using the first parameter. <BR>The third is a pointer to a <I>RECT 
</I>structure. This <I>RECT</I> structure holds the area in which the <I>OCX</I> 
should appear when in-place active. We use the global <I>CRect</I> object 
<I>z_Rect</I> that holds the initial &nbsp;dimensions of the <I>OCX</I> to 
initialize this parameter. <BR>The last and the most important parameter is a 
pointer to an <I>OLEINPLACEFRAMEINFO</I> structure. This structure holds details 
such as whether the container is an MDI application, pointer to the frame window 
etc. We initialize just one member of &nbsp;the structure to hold the handle to 
the container window. This is the only &nbsp;member of the structure that 
<I>has</I> to be initialized. This is why we use the <I>_fmemset()</I> function 
to set all other members of the structure to <B><I>0</i></B> at the start of 
<I>GetWindowContext()</I>.<BR>The interface <I>IOleInPlaceFrame</I> is required 
only if we are going to merge the <I>OCX</I> menus with the container menu; 
bring in the <I>OCX</I>'s toolbar and for other such actions. As of now, we do 
not use any function of this interface, but cannot do without it either. If we 
do not pass the address of an <I>IOleInPlaceFrame</I> instance to the <I>OCX</I> 
in the <I>GetWindowContext()</I> function then the <I>OCX</I> will appear 
embedded and not in-place.<BR>The first parameter to <I>DoVerb()</I> is 
<I>OLEIVERB_SHOW</I> to indicate that the <I>OCX</I> should appear in-place. It 
is passed the pointer to the interface <I>MOleClientSite</I> as the &nbsp;third 
parameter. In addition, the address of <I>z_Rect</I> is passed as the &nbsp;last 
parameter to <I>DoVerb()</I>. This indicates &nbsp;the &nbsp;size and position 
that the <I>OCX</I> is to occupy in the &nbsp;container's window.<BR>In the 
above explanation, you might have noticed that every thing seemed cut and dry. 
Use <I>SetClientSite()</I> before <I>DoVerb()</I> &nbsp;to pass the 
<I>IOleClientSite()</I> pointer &nbsp;to the <I>OCX</I>. The <I>OCX</I> will 
then use this pointer to call <I>QueryInterface()</I> with 
&nbsp;<I>IID_IOleInPlaceSite</I>. Use <I>GetWindow()</I> and 
<I>GetWindowContext()</I> &nbsp;of &nbsp;<I>IOleInPlaceSite</I> to pass all 
relevant information to the <I>OCX</I> etc.<BR>But things are not always as 
self-evident as they seem. Nowhere in the <I>OLE</I> documentation are the steps 
to follow in &nbsp;writing a container and/or a server stated 
explicitly.<BR>This sequence was something that <I>we</I> have figured out using 
our own devices. Before, we tackled the <I>OCX</I> container &nbsp;we had worked 
extensively on the <I>OLE</I> containers and both &nbsp;DLL and EXE servers that 
were written in C/C++ and studied the interaction between them in detail. We 
read between the lines and used native &nbsp;wisdom to piece together the 
complete &nbsp;picture. (<A href="http://users.neca.com/vmis/small.html">Small 
is Beautiful</A>).<BR>In the above example, the <I>OCX</I> expects the 
<I>IOleClientSite</I> function <I>GetWindow()</I> to return the window 
&nbsp;handle to it. Similarly, <I>GetWindowContext()</I> is expected to 
&nbsp;provide the <I>OCX</I> with other information necessary for in-place 
activation. If we do not provide the code in either <I>GetWindow()</I> or 
<I>GetWindowContext()</I> &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> will not appear in-place. 
Consider another scenario. What if &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> does not return an 
<I>IOleObject</I> pointer in <I>CreateInstance()</I>? The entire process will 
come to a grinding halt.<BR>While all through the <I>OLE</I> documentation 
alludes to what has to be done in the various functions of the interfaces, never 
ever does it state <I>when</I> the functions are to be used. Thus, <I>OLE</I> 
will work if and only if both participants follow certain rules. As long as 
everyone tows the line, the <I>OLE</I> apparatus works just fine. But one step 
out of line and the whole system collapses; faster than a house of 
cards.<BR>Unfortunately, the rules of <I>OLE</I> are <I>unstated</I>. Rules 
everyone &nbsp;know exist but cannot pin-point. As of now, trial and error is 
the only way that one learns about the rules of <I>OLE</I>. To say that the path 
to <I>OLE</I> is strewn with obstacles is an understatement of 
understatements.<BR>
<H2>Some meat on the bones</H2>Next we will add a few features to the container. 
For example, if an user clicks within the container window but outside &nbsp;of 
&nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> area when the <I>OCX</I> is in-place active, then &nbsp;the 
<I>OCX</I> will get hidden. And what's more! An image of it will be 
&nbsp;displayed on screen. There are several other such additions that have been 
made. <BR>

</PRE>The &nbsp;<I>OCX</I> will appear in-place. Notice that the <I>OCX</I> is 
now given a thin black line as a border. Click within the container window but 
not in the area occupied by the <I>OCX</I>. This will cause the actual 
<I>OCX</I> to be hidden from &nbsp;view, that is it is de-activated, and an 
image of it will be displayed instead. Note a change in the border. The image 
has a black solid-line border with the dots along the inside of the 
line.<BR>Click on the <I>OCX</I> image and drag the mouse around. The <I>OCX</I> 
image will move to the new location. Click on a dot along the border and drag 
the mouse. This will allow us to re-size the <I>OCX</I>. To re- activate the 
<I>OCX</I>, double click on the image. The <I>OCX</I> will appear in-place 
active at &nbsp;it's new position and in the new size.<BR>In <I>ObjCreate()</I>, 
we set the boolean variable <I>z_nActive</I> to <I>TRUE</I>. This indicates that 
the <I>OCX</I> is in-place active. <I>z_nActive </I>is used to hold the active 
status of the <I>OCX</I>. Every time the <I>OCX</I> is hidden it will be set to 
<I>FALSE</I>. <BR>When &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> appeared as an embedded object in 
our container, &nbsp;you must have noticed that it opened as a separate 
&nbsp;window. When we bring in an <I>OCX</I> as an in-place active object, all 
&nbsp;that happens is that the window of the container is set as the parent 
&nbsp;to the window of the <I>OCX</I>. The window of &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I>, thus, 
appears as a child within the container window. It has just a border and no 
caption or menu. As long as the <I>OCX</I> is active and we are within the 
bounds of it's &nbsp;window all the messages are passed to it's call-back 
function else &nbsp;they are sent to the call-back function of the 
container.<BR>A user may want to change the size and location of an in-place 
active <I>OCX</I> interactively. Since, the <I>OCX</I> window &nbsp;is a child 
within the container window with just a border, there &nbsp;is no way that we 
can directly change it's dimensions and position. So we resort to a bit of 
subterfuge. What if we had a rectangle around the <I>OCX</I>? The dimensions and 
position of which we could change with a mouse. We could then manipulate the 
&nbsp;rectangle and pass it's new size and/or position to the <I>OCX</I>. The 
<I>OCX</I> can use this information to redraw itself so as to occupy the new 
size and/or position. Such a rectangle can be created using the <I>MFC</I> and 
is called a <B><I>tracker</i></B>.<BR>The class <I>CRectTracker</I> of the 
<I>MFC</I> is used to implement a tracker in our application. In the constructor 
of the class <I>MFrameWnd,</I> we create a <I>CRectTracker</I> &nbsp;object. 
This object &nbsp;is initially set to have the same dimensions &nbsp;and 
position as the <I>OCX</I>. We have stipulated that the tracker is to initially 
appear as a solid line coinciding with the &nbsp;borders of the <I>OCX</I>. The 
advantage of using this class is that it provides built-in support that allows 
us to re-size and &nbsp;move the tracker with the aid of a mouse. The style of 
the tracker &nbsp;is changed &nbsp;so that the user is provided with a visual 
&nbsp;feedback &nbsp;on the status of the <I>OCX</I>.<BR>Every time we want to 
change the size and/or &nbsp;position &nbsp;of &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I>, &nbsp;we 
first click within the container window but outside of the area of the 
<I>OCX</I> to de-activate it. The message <I>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</I> will be sent to 
the container &nbsp;window's call-back function. <I>OnLButtonDown()</I> will get 
executed. In this &nbsp;function, we use <I>DoVerb()</I> with 
<I>OLEIVERB_HIDE</I> as the first parameter. This will hide the <I>OCX</I> 
window from view. What is now displayed is an image of &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I>. 
<I>z_nActive</I> is set to <I>FALSE</I> to indicate that the <I>OCX</I> is no 
longer active.<BR>Then, we click anywhere within the area bounded by the tracker 
rectangle and drag it around. The <I>CRectTracker</I> function <I>Track()</I> 
used in <I>OnMouseMove()</I> will be executed. It will update the 
<I>CRectTracker</I> variable <I>m_rect</I> to hold the new size and/or location 
of the tracker. We update our global variable <I>z_Rect</I> to hold these new 
dimensions and then repaint the container window so that the <I>OCX</I> image 
appears at the new location.<BR>In <I>OnPaint()</I> we initially check the 
status of <I>z_nActive</I> to determine if the <I>OCX</I> is active or hidden 
&nbsp;and appropriately change the style of the tracker.<BR>When the <I>OCX</I> 
is not in-place active, the image of &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> has to be drawn and 
this drawing is handled by the <I>OLE</I> API <I>OleDraw()</I>. To 
<I>OleDraw()</I>, we pass the <I>IOleObject</I> pointer of &nbsp;the 
&nbsp;<I>OCX</I>. <I>DVASPECT_CONTENT</I> specifies that the image of &nbsp;the 
<I>OCX</I> is to be rendered. We also pass <I>OleDraw()</I> a device context to 
the container window and the area where the image is to be drawn. 
<I>OleDraw()</I> uses all this data to draw a spitting image of the actual 
<I>OCX</I>.<BR>The <I>OCX</I> also has to be informed of it's &nbsp;new 
&nbsp;dimensions. <I>OLE</I> sets standards for any all information exchanges 
&nbsp;that are to take place. One such standard states that whenever dimensions 
are to be passed between applications, they must always be in <I>HIMETRIC</I> 
units. We convert the width and height &nbsp;which are in pixels to 
<I>HIMETRIC</I> using <I>XformWidthInPixelsToHimetric()</I> and 
<I>XformHeightInPixelsToHimetric()</I> respectively and store them in the 
<I>SIZEL</I>&nbsp;structure. Both of these are <I>OLE</I> UI functions. We pass 
the <I>SIZEL</I> structure which holds the new dimensions to&nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> 
through the&nbsp;function <I>SetExtent()</I> of &nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;interface 
<I>IOleObject</I>.<BR>Experience &nbsp;shows &nbsp;that these dimensions in 
<I>HIMETRIC</I> are converted back to pixel units by the <I>OCX</I>. Then why 
pass dimensions in <I>HIMETRIC</I>? Because <I>OLE</I> says so. If you write 
your own container and <I>OCX</I> then you can pass dimensions back and forth in 
pixels. But then nobody else who follows the <I>OLE</I> set standards will be 
able to communicate &nbsp;with you.<BR>Double click on the image to re-activate 
the <I>OCX</I>. Once again, a <I>DoVerb() </I>with <I>OLEIVERB_SHOW</I> as the 
first parameter is executed. In this case, in <I>OnPaint()</I>, the style of the 
tracker will be changed to indicate that the <I>OCX</I> is active and it will be 
displayed at the new position and size set using the tracker.<BR>
<H2>The OCX in action</H2>We had mentioned before that verbs provoke action 
in&nbsp;the <I>OCX</I>. However, the <I>OCX</I> has to have support for 
&nbsp;the action. What do we mean by support? Consider <I>OLEIVERB_OPEN</I>. 
When this verb is invoked on the <I>OCX</I>, there should be code provided in 
the &nbsp;<I>OCX</I> &nbsp;so that it opens as an embedded object. 
<BR>Consequently, this means that the <I>OCX</I> should have code for all the 
different verbs that it can be invoked with. However, it is not mandatory that 
all the <I>OCX</I>'s or indeed all <I>OLE</I> servers, should support all the 
verbs. It is upto the programmer writing &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I> to decide the 
verbs that it will support. <BR>In the next program, we have demonstrated the 
effect of a few &nbsp;of the verbs. We have assumed that all the <I>OCX</I>es 
brought into this container support these verbs.<BR>

</PRE>View the pop-up under the main menu-option <I>Edit...</I>. There will be a 
pop-up <I>Button Control</I> added to the end. This pop-up menu will hold six 
verbs that can be invoked on the <I>OCX</I>. See the effect of the different 
verbs on the <I>OCX</I>.<BR>In <I>ObjCreate()</I>, we retrieve a handle to the 
pop-up associated with the main menu option <I>Edit...</I>. To the end of this 
pop-up we add a pop-up of the verbs. This pop-up is a part of &nbsp;a menu 
resource; <I>IDR_MENU2</I>; in the <I>RC</I> file of &nbsp;the container. A 
handle to this pop-up menu is obtained and is used in <I>AppendMenu()</I>. 
<BR>We wanted the text for this pop-up to indicate the name of the <I>OCX</I> 
used. This name is obtained from the <I>OCX</I> with the help of the 
<I>IOleObject</I> function <I>GetUserType()</I>. When we call the function, the 
<I>OCX</I> fills up a previously allocated string &nbsp;with it's name. We 
append this string as the pop-up to the existing menu. We use the message map 
&nbsp;entries &nbsp;to trap messages from this pop-up and associate functions 
with them. All that these functions do is they call <I>DoVerb()</I> with the 
appropriate verb. <BR>It is interesting to see the effect of the 
<I>OLEIVERB_PROPERTIES</I> verb on the <I>OCX</I>. Selecting the sub-option 
<I>Properties</I> from the pop-up will call the function 
<I>PropertiesVerb()</I>. This will bring up a dialog box &nbsp;titled <I>`Button 
Control Properties'</I>. What you will see is a sneak preview of a significant 
feature of <I>Windows '95</I> in action! <BR>The dialog box that you see is the 
properties dialog box. Associated with each <I>OCX</I> there could be several 
properties, &nbsp;for example, color. To provide the user with an easy and 
standard method of changing the properties of an object, <I>Microsoft</I> has 
come up with the concept of <I>Property Pages</I>. <BR>A property page could be 
seen as a dialog box in which all the required information about one or more 
properties is available. For example, a property page dealing with fonts has 
information about the current font, point size, nature of font (bold, 
&nbsp;italics, etc.) and so on displayed in it. Naturally, this information can 
be modified. <BR>Some commonly used properties such as color, font etc. have 
been provided with standard property pages by <I>Microsoft</I>. For other 
properties unique property pages can be designed and implemented. A collection 
of all the property pages associated with a particular <I>OCX</I> is the 
properties dialog box for that <I>OCX</I>. <BR>In the <I>`Button Control 
Properties'</I> dialog box, there are two rectangles at the top titled 
<I>`General'</I> and <I>`Fonts'</I> respectively. These are called <I>tabs</I>. 
Clicking on any one of them brings up the property page associated with the 
title. By default, in this case, the dialog box displays the property page 
associated with <I>`General'.</I> This property page holds a single edit control 
titled <I>`Caption'.</I> Type in a string into this edit control. Click on the 
<I>`Apply &nbsp;Now'</I> button &nbsp;to see the changes made being applied to 
the <I>OCX</I>. In this way, the <I>`Caption'</I> property can be changed from 
the property page entitled <I>`General'</I>. <BR>Next click on the tab 
<I>`Fonts'.</I> This brings up the property page associated with fonts. This is 
a standard property page provided by <I>Microsoft</I>. <BR>The properties dialog 
box will also be displayed when we &nbsp;select the <I>Primary...</I> 
sub-option. Thus, a &nbsp;<I>DoVerb()</I> with <I>OLEIVERB_PRIMARY</I> as it's 
first parameter will produce the same results as a <I>DoVerb()</I> with 
<I>OLEIVERB_PROPERTIES</I>. Property pages are explained in greater detail later 
when we deal with properties of &nbsp;the <I>OCX</I>. We reiterate that the 
verbs are to be implemented by the <I>OCX</I>. The container has absolutely 
nothing to do with &nbsp;the verbs.<BR>
<H2>A choice in the matter</H2>In the above programs, we had hard-coded the name 
of the <I>OCX</I> to be activated. Ideally, the user should be able to select an 
<I>OCX</I> from those available at run-time.<BR>All the <I>OLE</I> servers are 
registered with <I>`reg.dat'</I>, the registration database. This is true of the 
<I>OCX</I>es &nbsp;too. So, &nbsp;we can read <I>`reg.dat'</I> to populate a 
listbox with &nbsp;the names of &nbsp;the available controls. This will allow 
the user to select the <I>OCX</I> that is to be used.<BR>Registering objects 
with the registration database calls for a bit of history. In the case of 
<I>OLE</I> servers, all you had to do was have an ASCII file with all details of 
the <I>OLE</I> server. This <I>`.reg'</I> file contained information like the 
<I>CLSID</I> of the server, the name of the server, the name of the 
<I>`.exe'</I> or <I>`.dll'</I> file, the verbs and so on. The <I>`.reg'</I> file 
used a program called <I>REGEDIT</I> to register the <I>OLE</I> server 
&nbsp;with the registration database, <I>`reg.dat'</I>.<BR><I>REGEDIT</I> does 
not&nbsp;resort to any mysterious mantra. It merely uses&nbsp;standard 
<I>Windows</I> API like <I>`RegOpenKey()'</I>, <I>`RegSetKey()'</I> and so on to 
write to the registration database. <BR>Displaying all the available <I>OLE</I> 
servers in a container program was child's play&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<I>OLE</I> UI 
function <I>OleUIInsertObject()</I>. On&nbsp;executing this function the 
<I>OLE</I> servers are displayed in a standard dialog box titled <I>`Insert 
Object'</I>.<BR>With the advent of <I>OCX</I>es, this standard <I>`Insert 
&nbsp;Object'</I> dialog has undergone a sea-change as seen in 
&nbsp;<I>Microsoft Access 2.0</I>. In the new <I>`Insert Object'</I> dialog box 
an additional radio-button is provided for <I>OCX</I>es. Selecting &nbsp;this 
radio-button enables us to exclusively see the registered 
<I>OCX</I>es.<BR>However, there is no documentation on how this new <I>`Insert 
Object'</I> dialog box can be obtained and made a part of the <I>OCX</I> 
container. There must be <I>something</I> in the <I>OCX</I> registration code 
that differentiates it from an conventional <I>OLE</I> server.<BR>We once again 
had to turn our attention to the <I>OCX</I> samples to understand the 
registration code. But in this particular &nbsp;case the <I>OCX</I> samples too 
were no big help. All <I>OCX</I> samples provided with <I>Visual C++</I> use the 
<I>MFC.</I> They have been generated using the <I>Control Wizard</I>. These 
applications &nbsp;have &nbsp;<I>OCX</I> registration code built into them and 
hence do not require a separate <I>`.reg'</I> file.<BR>Well, our 
<I>never-say-die</I> spirit carried us through &nbsp;this. After sifting through 
the code in the <I>OCX</I> samples we isolated the code used by an <I>OCX</I> to 
register itself. A single helper function; <I>AfxOleRegisterControlClass()</I>. 
We converted this function to the basic API registration functions only to 
realise that the only difference between the information in the registration 
code for an <I>OCX</I> and that in a <I>`.reg'</I> file for an <I>OLE</I> server 
is the presence of the keyword <B><I>`Control'</i></B>. <BR>Thus, we can easily 
have a <I>`.reg'</I> file to register an <I>OCX</I> which has the line 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\TheActualCLSIDOfTheControl\Control in addition to all 
the details that are normally present in &nbsp;the <I>`.reg'</I> file for an 
<I>OLE</I> server.<BR>In the following program we have created our own 
<I>`Insert Control'</I> dialog box which displays the names of only the 
<I>OCX</I>es from the registration database. <BR>

</PRE>When we select the menu-option <I>Insert &nbsp;Control...</I>, we create 
an <I>MDialog</I> object and pass it the ID of the dialog resource to be 
associated with it. The ID is stored in the global variable <I>z_nID.</I> Next, 
the <I>CDialog</I> function <I>DoModal()</I> is used to display the dialog 
box.<BR>In <I>OnInitDialog()</I>, we use the registration database functions of 
the <I>Windows</I>&nbsp;API to read <I>`reg.dat'</I>. <I>RegOpenKey()</I> is 
used to obtain a handle to required keys. Then, we use <I>RegEnumKey()</I> to 
access each individual sub-key.<BR>The <I>while</I> loop reads individual 
entries in <I>`reg.dat'</I> and uses suitable string concatenation to read the 
<I>CLSID</I>. Using the <I>CLSID</I>, we determine whether the entry is an 
<I>OCX</I> by searching for the keyword <I>Control</I>.<BR>If it is then the 
<I>CMapStringToString</I> object, <I>z_sPrgID</I>, is used to store both the 
human readable name of the &nbsp;<I>OCX</I> and the <I>ProgID</I> of &nbsp;the 
<I>OCX</I> as strings. <I>CMapStringToString</I> one of &nbsp;the MFC collection 
classes. The name acts as the key in the map which stores the <I>ProgID</I> as 
the value. In addition, the name of the <I>OCX</I> is added as an element in the 
listbox of the dialog. Thus, the listbox is populated with the names of all 
&nbsp;registered <I>OCX</I>es.<BR>When &nbsp;the user selects an <I>OCX</I> and 
clicks on the &nbsp;<I>OK</I> button, <I>OnOK()</I> gets executed. We determine 
the <I>OCX</I> selected by the user in the list box and search <I>z_sPrgID</I> 
for the allied <I>ProgID</I>. <I>CLSIDFromString()</I> will search 
<I>`reg.dat'</I> for the <I>CLSID</I> associated with this <I>ProgID</I>. The 
<I>CLSID</I> is then passed to <I>ObjCreate()</I> where it is used by 
<I>CoGetClassObject()</I> to activate the <I>OCX</I>.<BR>
